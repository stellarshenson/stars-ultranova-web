1. **Task - Project initialization**: Full project setup with Claude Code configuration and documentation<br>
   **Result**: Initialized Stars Nova Web project as a Python/FastAPI/uvicorn port of the Stars! 4X strategy game from C# reference in `stars-nova-orig-c#/`. Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with workspace import directive, mandatory bans section, technology stack (Python 3.11+, FastAPI, uvicorn, HTML/CSS/JS frontend), and code porting rules requiring exact logic preservation from C# source. Updated `.gitignore` with Python patterns (pycache, venv, eggs, pytest, coverage) plus reference implementation exclusion. Updated `README.md` with setup instructions including venv creation and uvicorn dev server command. Git repository pre-existed.
